## SQL-like Databases

Although there is a good bit of hype around interesting NoSQL databases and key/values stores, SQL-like databases are still ubiquitous.  You can access, query, and otherwise interact with such databases via the `databases/sql` package in Go stdlib.  There are a variety of libraries for `databases/sql` that allow you to connect to MySQL, Postgres, etc.  In the following, we will be using a Postgres database hosted by [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to illustrate database/sql functionality. 

## Get a Postgres server

- Create an account on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
- Create a free "tiny turtle" instance.
- Get the URL from the details page of your "tiny turtle" instance.
- Export this URL to a environmental variable `PGURL`.
- Install the `psql` CLI tool.

## Notes

* A `sql.DB` value is not a database connection.   
* Using the `sql.DB` value, `databases/sql` (i) opens and closes connections to the actual underlying database, via the specified driver, and (ii) manages a pool of connections as needed.
* If you fail to release connections, you can cause `databases/sql` to open a lot of connections.  
* After creating a `sql.DB` value, you can use it to query the database, execute statements, and commit transactions. 
* When you iterate over rows and scan them into variables, Go performs data type conversions behind the scenes.

## JSON Data

Typically JSON is used when ease-of-use is the primary goal of data interchange. Because JSON is human-readable, it is easy to debug if something breaks.  Many APIs and datastores/caches represent data in JSON, and, without a doubt, you will have to work with JSON as a data scientist.  

## Notes

* Support for Decoding and Encoding JSON are provided by the standard libary.
* This package gets better and better with every release.
